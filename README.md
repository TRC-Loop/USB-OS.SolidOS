# SolidOS
A "OS" for your USB-Stick, plug-in and run.
**Not a real OS!**

# Installation Tutorial
1. Press on the Code button
2. Download the ZIP File

Format your USB Drive
### All of you Files on the USB Drive will be *Deleted*! I do not pay for the Damage.

## What filesystem is good?

**exFat** is *Recommended*.
It runs nearly everywhere and is Fast.

**FAT32** is Low-End.
It runs everywhere but can only store files up to 4GB.

**NTFS** is not recommended
It runs on Windows. It is fast but not for USB Drives.

## Windows
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to `This PC`
3. Rightclick you USB Drive
4. Press on `Format...`
5. Uncheck `Fast Format` if the USB Capacity is lower or is 16GB.
6. Select the Filesystem (See Filesystem).
7. Press `Ok`, the Process can take half a hour.
8. Move the Downloaded Zip File into your new Formatted USB Drive.
9. Extract the Downloaded ZIP File with 7-Zip or WinRAR or the built-in ZIP Extractor in Windows.
10. Create a shortcut to OS/Booot/BIOS.exe
11. Now just double-click onto the Shortcut and the OS should run.
#### Troubleshooting
Download won´t work? Try it later.
The OS won´t run? Download and Install Python (https://python.org/download).
There are errors as ModuleNotFound? Try going into the OS Directory and open a Console and type `py -m pip install -r librarys.txt` (Python Installation needed)

# Important
- Before you remove the USB from your PC, make sure to exit the program using `exit` and eject the drive.
